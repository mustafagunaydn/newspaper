        <h3><a href="#">Focus Appears to Be on Material Taken From White House</a></h3>
        <p>Former President Trump said the F.B.I. searched Mar-a-Lago, his club and home in Palm Beach, Fla., and broke
            open a safe. He was in the New York area at the time.
            The search seemed to center on documents taken from the White House. It would almost surely have required
            top officials to sign off.</p>
